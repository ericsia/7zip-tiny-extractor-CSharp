# Tiny7z

## TO DO LIST

- [ ] Allow per-file (or files group) compression settings (solid/non solid)
- [ ] Allow compressing in different coders (LZMA2, etc.)

## DONE

- [x] Replace digests with arrays of CRCs (improved Digests instead)
- [x] When SubStreamsInfo exists, fields have to be properly filled/guessed from other fields
- [x] When writing SubStreamsInfo, I have to undo these guesses to write them
- [x] Add constants for hard-coded values
- [x] Compressed header
- [x] Replace clunky bool vectors with adapted vectors with data used
- [x] Compress one file
- [x] Ensure MultiFileStream.Source cleanup
- [x] Better extract/compress interface
- [x] Add BCJ and BCJ2 filters
- [x] Add multiple coders per folder support for decompression
- [x] Add progress report for compression and decompression
- [x] Add AES password handling to enable decryption
- [x] Fully implement ProgressDelegate calls with file details
- [x] Implement access protection with internal where appropriate
- [x] Ensure no duplicate files when not "preserving directory structure" (handle overwriting per file at least)
- [x] Better tracing
